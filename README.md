# Azure Pipelines Artifact Caching Tasks

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/1es-cat/azure-pipelines-artifact-caching-tasks/_apis/build/status/Microsoft.azure-pipelines-artifact-caching-tasks?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/1es-cat/azure-pipelines-artifact-caching-tasks/_build/latest?definitionId=17&branchName=master) [![Release status](https://vsrm.dev.azure.com/1es-cat/_apis/public/Release/badge/73af267c-80da-42c5-b634-ef63bb6d61fc/1/1)](https://dev.azure.com/1es-cat/azure-pipelines-artifact-caching-tasks/_release?definitionId=1)

This repo contains the tasks that enable the caching of intermediate artifacts from an Azure Pipelines build using Universal Artifacts.

## How to use

This build task is meant to add an easy way to provide caching of intermediate build artifacts. To demonstrate, let's examine the following build definition snippet:

```yaml
- task: 1ESLighthouseEng.PipelineArtifactCaching.RestoreCacheV1.RestoreCache@1
  inputs:
    keyfile: "**/yarn.lock, !**/node_modules/**/yarn.lock, !**/.*/**/yarn.lock"
    targetfolder: "**/node_modules, !**/node_modules/**/node_modules"
    vstsFeed: "$(ArtifactFeed)"

- script: |
    yarn install
  displayName: Install Dependencies

- task: 1ESLighthouseEng.PipelineArtifactCaching.SaveCacheV1.SaveCache@1
  inputs:
    keyfile: "**/yarn.lock, !**/node_modules/**/yarn.lock, !**/.*/**/yarn.lock"
    targetfolder: "**/node_modules, !**/node_modules/**/node_modules"
    vstsFeed: "$(ArtifactFeed)"
```

Conceptually, this snippet creates a lookup key from the `keyfile` argument and checks the `vstsFeed` for a matching entry. If one exists, it will be downloaded and unpacked. After more `node_modules` are restored via `yarn` the `SaveCache` task runs to create a cache entry if it wasn't available previously (if a cache entry was downloaded, this is a no-op).

Inputs:

- `keyfile`: The file or pattern of files to use for creating the lookup key of the cache. Due to the nature of `node_modules` potentially having their own `yarn.lock` file, this snippet explicitly excludes that pattern to ensure there is a consistent lookup key before and after package restoration.
- `targetfolder`: The file/folder or pattern of files/folders that you want to cache. The matching files/folders will be represented as the universal package that is uploaded to your Azure DevOps artifact feed.
- `vstsFeed`: The guid representing the artifact feed in Azure DevOps meant to store the build's caches.

If you do not want to add two build steps to your build definition, you can also use a single task that implicitly adds the `SaveCache` task at the end of the build. For example:

```yaml
- task: 1ESLighthouseEng.PipelineArtifactCaching.RestoreAndSaveCacheV1.RestoreAndSaveCache@1
  inputs:
    keyfile: "**/yarn.lock, !**/node_modules/**/yarn.lock, !**/.*/**/yarn.lock"
    targetfolder: "**/node_modules, !**/node_modules/**/node_modules"
    vstsFeed: "$(ArtifactFeed)"

- script: |
    yarn install
  displayName: Install Dependencies
```

## Optimistic cache restoration

If a cache was restored successfully, the build variable `CacheRestored` is set to `true`. This can provide a further performance boost by optionally skipping package install commands entirely.

In the following example, the 'yarn' task will only run if there was not a cache hit. Although this can provide faster builds, it may not be suitable for production builds.

```yaml
- task: 1ESLighthouseEng.PipelineArtifactCaching.RestoreAndSaveCacheV1.RestoreAndSaveCache@1
  inputs:
    keyfile: "**/yarn.lock, !**/node_modules/**/yarn.lock, !**/.*/**/yarn.lock"
    targetfolder: "**/node_modules, !**/node_modules/**/node_modules"
    vstsFeed: "$(ArtifactFeed)"

- script: |
    yarn install
  displayName: Install Dependencies
  condition: ne(variables['CacheRestored'], 'true')
```

### Cache aliases

By default, the name of the variable used for optimistic cache restoration defaults to `CacheRestored`. However, this can be problematic in restoring multiple caches in the same build (E.g. caches for build output and for packages). To work around this, you may set an optional task variable to control the naming of the `CacheRestored` variable.

For example:

```yaml
- task: 1ESLighthouseEng.PipelineArtifactCaching.RestoreAndSaveCacheV1.RestoreAndSaveCache@1
  inputs:
    keyfile: "yarn.lock"
    targetfolder: "node_modules"
    vstsFeed: "$(ArtifactFeed)"
    alias: "Packages"

- script: |
    yarn install
  displayName: Install Dependencies
  condition: ne(variables['CacheRestored-Packages'], 'true')
```

## Platform independent caches

By default, cached archives are platform _dependent_ to support the small differences that may occur in packages produced for a specific platform. If you are certain that the cached archive will be platform _independent_, you can set the task variable `platformIndependent` to true and all platforms will restore the same archive.

For example:

```yaml
- task: 1ESLighthouseEng.PipelineArtifactCaching.RestoreCacheV1.RestoreCache@1
  inputs:
    keyfile: keyfile
    targetfolder: bin
    vstsFeed: $(ArtifactFeed)
    platformIndependent: true
```

## Onboarding

1. Install the extension from the [marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=1ESLighthouseEng.PipelineArtifactCaching) into your Azure DevOps organization.
2. Ensure [Azure Artifacts](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/artifacts/) is enabled for your organization.
3. Create a new Azure Artifacts feed to store caches in. After creating the feed, the GUID will be referenced in your build definition. In the examples above, `ArtifactFeed` is a build variable equal to the GUID of the Azure Artifact feed.

_Note:_ The GUID for your Azure Artifact feed can be found either by using the Azure DevOps [rest apis](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azure/devops/artifacts/feed%20%20management/get%20feeds?view=azure-devops-rest-5.0#response) or by creating a build task in the traditional visual designer that references the feed and then selecting "View YAML".

## Known limitations

The task is designed to only cache artifacts that are produced within the build's root directory. This works best for packages that follow this convention (e.g. NPM and NuGet), but not for artifacts that are produced outside of the repo's directory (e.g. Maven).

The task skips restoring and saving caches on forked repositories by design. This is a security measure to protect cached artifacts from forked sources and a limitation from the Azure Artifacts permissions model (users of forked repositories don't have access to download these artifacts).

The task is only available to be used within Azure DevOps Services because Azure DevOps Server does not support Universal Packages.

## How to build

### Prerequisites: Node and NPM

**Windows and Mac OSX**: Download and install node from [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org/)

**Linux**: Install [using package manager](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager)

From a terminal ensure at least node 4.2 and npm 5:

```bash
$ node -v && npm -v
v4.2.0
5.6.0
```

To install npm separately:

```
[sudo] npm install npm@5 -g
npm -v
5.6.0
```

Note: On Windows, if it's still returning npm 2.x, run `where npm`. Notice hits in program files. Rename those two npm files and the 5.6.0 in AppData will win.

### Install Dependencies

Once:

```bash
npm install
```

### Build

The following instructions demonstrate how to build and test either all or a specific task. The output will be sent to
the `_build` directory. You can then use the tfx client to upload this to your server for testing.

The build will also generate a `task.loc.json` and an english strings file under `Strings` in your source tree. You should check these back in. Another localization process will create the other strings files.

To build all tasks:

```bash
npm run build
```

Optionally, you can build a specific task:

```bash
node make.js build --task RestoreCacheV1
```
